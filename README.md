# WildPi-TurnGameEngine

This framework is the result of my interest in turn-based games. My goal is to develop a general framework which is capable of describing any turn-based game. If no general structure can be found, then I hope to develop a framwork for different classifications of turn-based games.

## Attribution

You want to use this framework? Great! I only ask you to do two things:
1. Provide a way for your users or readers to find this page and repository. (This will help me spread awareness and improve the framework).
2. Fork the repository on GitHub! This will help me understand who is using the framework and will allow you to get any updates and improvements that I make to the framework.
